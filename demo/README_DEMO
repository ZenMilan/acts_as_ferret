Acts_as_Ferret demo project
===========================

To use this demo, you'll need to set up a database for it.
SQL scripts for both SQLite and MySQL are provided in db/ .

Just set up one of these, and configure your db connection 
in config/database.yml .

after that run 
rake
to see the unit tests pass.

If using rails > 1.2.3
----------------------
do
  script/plugin install svn://errtheblog.com/svn/plugins/classic_pagination
to avoid some pagination errors (Thanks to Sam Giffney for pointing this 
out).
